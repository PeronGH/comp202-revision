- Algorithm analysis - time and space complexity, theoretical vs experimental analysis

- Big-O, Ω, Θ notation and asymptotic run time analysis

- Common functions - logarithmic, linear, quadratic, polynomial, exponential

- Proof techniques - induction, contradiction, contrapositive, counterexample
